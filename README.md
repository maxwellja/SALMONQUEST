# SALMONQUEST


I moved from Illinois to Oregon in the summer of 2022, and I was eager to catch salmon on all the ocean-feeding rivers that neighbor my new home. There's one problem, I don't know when salmon are running! In this project, I will answer the following question: 

About when in the year should I go fishing in the Columbia River to have the highest historical probably of catching a salmon for dinner?

To answer this question, I will systematically extract, process, and analyze csv data courtesy of Columbia Basin Research's Columbia River DART dashboard: https://www.cbr.washington.edu/dart/overview .

The data is salmon passage numbers from each day in 2022. With 2023 beginning, the best time to fish last year can allow me to project when the best time to fish this year will probably occur.

This project is broken up into four parts: Extraction, Cleaning, Analysis, and Presentation. I leverage the pandas library of python for the Extraction, Cleaning, and Analysis portions. I create a visualization with both Excel and Tableau to concisely display my findings and support my conclusion.
